You can choose one of a fractal set or a logistic map from the main menu,
then you can see its shape and zoom it by pinching the iPhone/iPod Touch screen.

You can save your favorite shape to Photo Album from a menu which is shown up
by touching the screen for a second.

You can also go back to the main menu from that menu.
